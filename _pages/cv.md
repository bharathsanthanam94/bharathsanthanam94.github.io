Education
=========

* MSc Autonomous Systems, Department of Computer Science, Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, Sankt Augustin, Germany
  * Expected graduation September 2024
* M.S. Mechanical Engineering, 2018, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA.
* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, 2015, SASTRA University, India

Work experience
===============

* ### Master thesis student , Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, Germany

  Focused on making robot manipulation safer, this work addresses the issue that robots trained in simulations often face problems when deployed in the real world. The approach involves monitoring robots in real time for unusual behaviors and implementing recovery strategies to ensure they return to a safe state.

  Key tasks include reinforcement learning, simulation to real-world deployment, real-time monitoring and recovery strategies
