ðŸŽ“ I am graduating with a Master's degree in Autonomous Systems from the Department of Computer Science at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg.

ðŸ“š My Master's thesis focuses on safe robot manipulation using computer vision and deep reinforcement learning.

ðŸ¤– I am passionate about building solutions for real-world robotics deployment and creating production-ready machine learning applications for business use cases.

ðŸŽ“ I hold a Graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University, USA, and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from SASTRA University, India.

ðŸ’¼ I am currently looking for full-time roles in the following fields: machine learning, deep learning for vision and language applications, and deploying large language models. I am open to exploring job opportunities in the European Union and Canada.

About me:
=========

Deep learning excites me. I'm actively applying it to real projects in agriculture and robotics. My journey from mechanical engineering to AI has shown me the transformative power of software in today's world. I am currently exploring large language models for RAG applications, and deploying machine learning models in production environments. My diverse backgrounds, spanning different cultures and industries, has taught me the value of human connections and an action-first mindset. Outside of work, I enjoy watching sports, particularly cricket and tennis, and find that Indian music helps me stay grounded.

I believe in the unique potential of every individual to create value, and I'm excited to collaborate and make a positive impact together.
